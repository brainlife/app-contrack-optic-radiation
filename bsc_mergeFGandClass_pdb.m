function [mergedFG, mergedClassification]=bsc_mergeFGandClass(inputFGs,inputClassifications)
%% [mergedFG, mergedClassification]=bsc_mergeFGandClass(inputFGs,inputClassifications)
%
% Takes in some number of fg structures (and classification structures) and
% merges them together into one omnibus fg structure (and classification
% structure) wherein the streamiline ordering (and this classification
% indexing) is preserved.
%
%% Inputs/Outputs
% Inputs:
% -inputFGs: either a series of paths to fg structures or an array of fg
% structures. Can be interspersed, and adapt to whatever input type (i.e.
% random assortment of strings, tck, objects etc).
% -inputClassifications: same as above, except for classification
% structures.  Might be slightly more brittle.
%
% Outputs:
% mergedFG: a fibergroup (fg) structure who streamines correspond to all input
% fibergroups (fg)s
% mergedClassification:  a classification structure which
%
%%   IMPORTANT NOTES:
%
%  >THIS FUNCTION REQUIRES VISTASOFT
%
%  >You do not have to put in a classification structure.  In such cases it
%  will basically behave like fgMerge, except it keeps track of the source
%  fibergroups (fg)s in the cassification structure.  Without the
%  classification structure there is no "provenance" on where the source
%  fibergroups came from (which may be fine, given your goals).
%
%  >Input FG structures and classificaiton structures are presumed to be
%  paired.  In other words, in the event that ANYTHING is passed in through
%  the inputClassifications variable (see above), it is presumed that the
%  ii entry in inputFGs corresponds to the ii entry in inputClassifications
%
%  >Even if two classification structures come from the same fg structure it
%  is still necessary to input the appropriate fg + classification pairing.
%  In other words, no orphan classification structures.
%
%
%% Example Uses:
%
%  1.  Merging a tracking parameter sweep:  If you have several different
%  fgs generated by different tractography parameter settings, this will
%  provide a merged fg structure along with a classification structure
%  telling you which streamlines came from which source tractography
%
%  2.  Merging multiple segmentations:  By inputting multiple source whole
%  brain fiber groups (from the same subject), along with the classification structure from each
%  corresponding segmentation, you can create a "merged replication
%  segmentation" which presumably has more streamlines representing each
%  particular tract.
%  NOTE:  Distinct whole brain fiber groups and segmentations can be used.
%  For example...
%
%  wbfg1 & classification method 1 + wbfg2 & classification method 1
%                           or
%  wbfg1 & classification method 1 + wbfg1 & classification method 2
%                           or
%  wbfg1 & classification method 1 + wbfg2 & classification method 2
%                           or
%  etc
%
%  3.  Incorporating tracts generated from other methods into an exsting
%  whole brain fiber group and segmentation:  if one already has a whole
%  brain tractography (and corresponding tractography)  it is possible to
%  "append" more tracts to the source wbfg and classification structure.
%  The tracts to be appended do not need corresponding classification
%  structures and will be added to the existing classification structure
%  (the one that corresponds to the whole brain tractography, should it
%  exist).  Their names will be derived from the name in the fg.name field.
